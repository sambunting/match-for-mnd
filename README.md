Website for listing players which are/aren't taking part in [Gethin Jones' Match For MND](https://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/2021/september/wanderers-support-jones-family-mnd--appeal/).

The website lists all available and unavailable players and can be contributed by creating a `json` file in the `players` folder.

All players, available or unavailable are assigned with a source.

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) website which reads JSON files at build time, and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
